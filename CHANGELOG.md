# bedrock-meter-usage-reporter ChangeLog

## 2.0.0 - 2021-08-xx

- **BREAKING**: The configuration now supports multiple named clients to
  enable multiple services to run within the same application. While some
  systems will be deployed in a microservices architecture whereby each
  service runs independently, others will bundle all services; this change
  allows both architectures to be supported. Applications that use this
  module only need to update their configuration settings to use the new
  format, no other changes are necessary.

## 1.0.0 - 2021-07-22

### Added
- Added core files.
